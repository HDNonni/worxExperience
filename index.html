        <p> First day jitters... what do I do? what is expected of me? </p>

    <p class = "styleP" >So of course any new job causes first day jitters however when changing careers at a later time in life to a very

        broad and complex world , well jitters is putting it mildly! </p>

    <p class = "styleP">I have worked extemely hard to learn and understand the world of technology and am grateful for the opportunity

        to use the skills I have acquired and con't to increase my knowledge.</p>

    <p class = "styleP">The first day was filled with getting all the passwords , meeting new people, getting my work station set up and

        finding my way around the office.</p>

    <div id="P2">

            <p>And then it was better when everyone made me feel welcome and part of the team!</p>

    </div>

    <p class = "styleP"> So now I find myself content loading/ translating to Chinese (中文) in Concrete5. My office mates have made me feel

        welcome and are patient as I learn to navigate around the CMS . Getting a glimpse at php and reading some of the

        code has given me the drive to learn more of php and so , at home I started a course.</p>

    <p class = "styleP">Certainly, one course will not make me an expert, however it will hopefully give me enough understanding to make

        some contributions to future projects.</p>

 

    <div id=P3>

        <p>Now I learn new things everyday and practice what I learned whenever I can</p>

        <p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/computer-computers-keyboards-zKNxmEraPcoKI"></a></p>

    </div>

    <p class = "styleP">So now in week 4 I have met some great people, been fed, taken on a road trip, delved deeper into concrete5, gotten 2 certifications with Google Analytics, and now creating this simple website so that I can practice a new skill , SASS!</p>

    <p class = "styleP"> I look forward to updating this little site with the new stuff I learn and the experiences that help me to grow in this new and exciting career!</p>

    <div>

        <p id=P4>Thanks for the Opportunity!</p>
